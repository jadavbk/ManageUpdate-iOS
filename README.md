<h1>Getting Started</h1>

To use this component in your project you need to perform the below steps:

> Steps to Integrate


1) Add `ManageUpdateVC.swift` and `ManageUpdateVC.xib` at the required place on your code.

2) Add below code where you want to Integrate Manage update feature in the controller:

*You have to add `getUpdatedVersion()` function in you AppDelegate or in AppUtitlity Class.
This function will have API call where you can get the latest version of the live app. 
Now compare the live version with Lcoal version of the app. 

3) If you get diffrenent verision or heigher version you can call the 
`func getUpdateWithDict(dictData : NSDictionary)` function to show the Manageupdate dialog. 

* Add getUpdateWithDict function:
```
    func getUpdateWithDict(dictData : NSDictionary)  {
        ManageUpdateVC.showPopup(strTitle: "New Update Available!!!", dictData: dictData,viewController: self, completion: { (sender) -> Void in
            print("\(sender.tag)")
            if sender.tag == 101 {
                if let url = URL(string: ""), UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(url) {
                    if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
                        //This will open the app store in the app with iTunes App URL.
                        UIApplication.shared.open(url, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)
                    } 
                    else {
                        //Fallback on earlier versions
                        UIApplication.shared.openURL(url)
                    }
                }
            }
            else {
                //Close Popup login
            }
        })
    }
```
